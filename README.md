## About Me 
Born and raised in Italy, I moved to the UK in 2015. I have always been interested in new technologies and IT, as I studied IT in my A levels back in Italy. After 5 years working in content management for a website, I decided to make the step of learning Front-End Development thanks to the edX course, and on my gitHub profile I showcase not only my progress in Front-End Development as a student but also a journey that hopefully will lead to new exciting projects in this field.

## Usage

You can visit the JavaScript Quiz Game website by clicking [HERE](https://nikola84ca.github.io/Weather-Website/). Alternatively to the url above, you can clone the repository on your device as shown in the Installation section below and access the index.html file by opening it in your browser. Here is a gif animation of the step-by-step procedure to search for the weather forecast for a specific city:

## Installation
First, make sure that Git and Git Bash are installed on your system. To download this project on your machine click [HERE](https://github.com/Nikola84ca/Weather-Website) to go to the repository on GitHub. Click on the green CODE button, and copy the link of the repository. In your machine, open gitBash and create a new folder where you will clone the project using the command below:

```bash
Git mkdir your-project-folder
```
navigate inside the new folder, and clone the project files with the following comands

```bash
cd your-project-folder
Git clone url-copied-on-repository
git pull
```

Open your editor with the command

```bash
code .
```

alternatively download the zip file in GitHub after pressing the Code button, unzip it and copy it in your project folder. Navigate to the folder using the cd command on gitbash and lounch your editor as shown above with "code ." to open the Weather Website page simply open the index.html file on your browser and follow the procedure as shown in the following animation:


## Website Description 

The website is a one-page site that will use JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs to create a weather website that will allow users to input the name of a city and retrive the weather forecast for the current day and for the five days after. Every time a new city is searched, the page will refresh the screen view, and add a new button with the name of the new city. The button will allow the user to retrive quickly the data of each city of interest, by keeping the buttons in the local storage. Every time the user presses that button the user will show the updated forecast for that location. I included also a button to clear the search history, this will delete all city buttons created and allows the user to start a brand new search.

## Credits

I would like to thank all the teachers and TA of the EdX bootcamp for all the content provided and study materials.

## Project Status and Upcoming Improvements

The Webpage is functional and easy to navigate, the user can search for a city by name and view the relative weather forecast for the current day and for the five weeks after. Once the user performs a search, a new button is created that will be saved in the internal storage and will allow the user, by pressing it, to perform an updated search relative to that city. The clear history button works as intended and clears all the data from the internal storage. There are some improvements to be done in the layout, so the next step will involve a better set up and implementation through the CSS styling.
